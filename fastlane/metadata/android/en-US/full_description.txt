Auxio is a local music player with a fast, reliable UI/UX without the many useless features present in other music players. Built off of <a href="https://exoplayer.dev/">Exoplayer</a>, Auxio has a much better listening experience compared to other apps that use the native MediaPlayer API. In short, <b>It plays music.</b>
