Auxio is a local music player designed to be simple, straightfoward, and customizable. It has a fast, reliable UI/UX, and it is not bloated with useless features. In short, <b>It plays music.</b> Auxio is still configurable however, with both the UI and behavior able to be changed to ones liking. Unlike other music players, Auxio is also based off of <a href="https://exoplayer.dev/">Exoplayer</a>, allowing for much better listening experience compared to the native MediaPlayer API.
