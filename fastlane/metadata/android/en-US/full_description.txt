Auxio is a local music player designed to be simple, straightfoward, and customizable. It has a fast, reliable UI/UX, and it is not bloated with useless features. In short, <b>It plays music.</b>

Unlike other music players, Auxio is based off of <a href="https://exoplayer.dev/">Exoplayer</a>, allowing for much better listening experience compared to the native MediaPlayer API. Auxio's codebase is also designed to be extendable, allowing for the addition of features that are not included in the main app.
