/**
 * This class does pretty much all the black magic required to get a remotely sensible music
 * indexing system while still optimizing for time. I would recommend you leave this file now
 * before you lose your sanity trying to understand the hoops I had to jump through for this
 * system, but if you really want to stay, here's a debrief on why this code is so awful.
 *
 * MediaStore is not a good API. It is not even a bad API. Calling it a bad API is an insult to
 * other bad android APIs, like CoordinatorLayout or InputMethodManager. No. MediaStore is a
 * crime against humanity and probably a way to summon Zalgo if you look at it the wrong way.
 *
 * You think that if you wanted to query a song's genre from a media database, you could just
 * put "genre" in the query and it would return it, right? But not with MediaStore! No, that's
 * too straightfoward for this class that was dropped on it's head as a baby. So instead, you
 * have to query for each genre, query all the songs in each genre, and then iterate through those
 * songs to link every song with their genre. This is not documented anywhere, and the
 * O(mom im scared) algorithm you have to run to get it working single-handedly DOUBLES Auxio's
 * loading times. At no point have the devs considered that this column is absolutely busted, and
 * instead focused on adding infuriat- I mean nice proprietary extensions to MediaStore for their
 * own Google Play Music, and we all know how great that worked out!
 *
 * It's not even ergonomics that makes this API bad. It's base implementation is completely borked
 * as well. Did you know that MediaStore doesn't accept dates that aren't from ID3v2.3 MP3 files?
 * I sure didn't, until I decided to upgrade my music collection to ID3v2.4 and Xiph only to see
 * that their metadata parser has a brain aneurysm the moment it stumbles upon a dreaded TRDC or
 * DATE tag. Once again, this is because internally android uses an ancient in-house metadata
 * parser to get everything indexed, and so far they have not bothered to modernize this parser
 * or even switch it to something more powerful like Taglib, not even in Android 12. ID3v2.4 has
 * been around for 21 years. It can drink now. All of my what.
 *
 * Not to mention all the other infuriating quirks. Album artists can't be accessed from the albums
 * table, so we have to go for the less efficent "make a big query on all the songs lol" method
 * so that songs don't end up fragmented across artists. Pretty much every OEM has added some
 * extension or quirk to MediaStore that I cannot reproduce, with some OEMs (COUGHSAMSUNGCOUGH)
 * crippling the normal tables so that you're railroaded into their music app. The way I do
 * blacklisting relies on a deprecated method, and the supposedly "modern" method is SLOWER and
 * causes even more problems since I have to manage databases across version boundaries. Sometimes
 * music will have a deformed clone that I can't filter out, sometimes Genres will just break for no
 * reason, sometimes this spaghetti parser just completely breaks down and is unable to get any
 * metadata. Everything is broken in it's own special unique way and I absolutely hate it.
 *
 * Is there anything we can do about it? No. Google has routinely shut down issues that begged google
 * to fix glaring issues with MediaStore or to just take the API behind the woodshed and shoot it.
 * Largely because they have zero incentive to improve it, especially for such obscure things
 * as indexing music. As a result, some players like Vanilla and VLC just hack their own pidgin
 * version of MediaStore from their own parsers, but this is both infeasible for Auxio due to how
 * incredibly slow it is to get a file handle from the android sandbox AND how much harder it is
 * to manage a database of your own media that mirrors the filesystem perfectly. And even if I set
 * aside those crippling issues and changed my indexer to that, it would face the even larger
 * problem of how google keeps trying to kill the filesystem and force you into their
 * ContentResolver API. In the future MediaStore could be the only system we have, which is also the
 * day that greenland melts and birthdays stop happening forever.
 *
 * I'm pretty sure nothing is going to happen and MediaStore will continue to be neglected and
 * probably deprecated eventually for a "new" API that just coincidentally excludes music indexing.
 * Because go screw yourself for wanting to listen to music you own. Be a good consoomer and listen
 * to your AlgoPop StreamMixâ„¢ instead.
 *
 * I wish I was born in the neolithic.
