# Auxio - Frequently Asked Questions

For a list of **supported formats** read [Supported Formats](FORMATS.md)

This FAQ will be continually updated as new changes and updates are made to Auxio.

#### Where can I download Auxio?

Auxio is available on the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.oxycblt.auxio/) repository.
Auxio is not and will never be on the play store due to it being a proprietary and draconian platform.

#### Auxio doesn't load my music correctly!

This is probably caused by one of two reasons:

1. If other players like Phonograph or Retro Music load it correctly, then Auxio has a bug and it should be [reported](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Auxio/issues).
2. If the aforementioned players don't work, but players like Vanilla Music and VLC do, then it's a problem with the Media APIs that Auxio relies on. There is nothing I can do about it.

#### I have a large library and Auxio takes really long to load it!

This is expected since reading media takes awhile, especially with libraries containing 10k songs or more.
I do hope to mitigate this in the future by allowing one to customize the music loader to optimize for speed instead of accuracy.

#### Why ExoPlayer?

ExoPlayer is far more flexible than the native MediaPlayer API, which allows consistent behavior across devices & OEMs and the
ability to be extended to music sources outside of local files. You can read more about the benefits (and drawbacks) of ExoPlayer
[Here](https://exoplayer.dev/pros-and-cons.html).

#### What formats does Auxio support?

As per the [Supported ExoPlayer Formats](https://exoplayer.dev/supported-formats.html), Auxio supports the following:

âœ… = Supported

ðŸ‘Ž = Not supported well

| Format | Supported | Comments |
|--------|-----------|-----------
| MP4    | âœ… | |
| MP3    | âœ… | |
| MKA    | âœ… | |
| OGG    | âœ… | Containing Vorbis, Opus, and FLAC |
| WAV    | âœ… | |
| MPEG   | âœ… | |
| AAC    | âœ… | |
| FLAC   | ðŸ‘Ž | Supported on Android 8.1 or newer. Auxio must be patched with the [FLAC Extension](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/tree/release-v2/extensions/flac) on lower versions. |

#### Why are accents lighter/less saturated in dark mode?

As per the [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html), accents should be less
saturated on dark mode to reduce eye strain and to increase visual cohesion.

#### Why isn't edge-to-edge enabled on versions below Oreo?

The APIs for changing system bar colors were only added in API Level 27 (Android Oreo), meaning that edge-to-edge will not work below that version.

#### Does this app keep/send any information about myself or my device?

Auxio does not log any information about the device or its owner, and it has no internet access to send that information off in the first place.

#### How can I contribute/report issues?

Open an [Issue](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Auxio/issues) or a [Pull Request](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Auxio/pulls),
please note the [Contribution Guidelines](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Accepted Additions](ADDITIONS.md) however.

#### Can I translate Auxio to my native language?

See the [Translations](https://github.com/OxygenCobalt/Auxio/issues/3) issue for guidance on how to create translations and submit them to the project.
Any contributions are appreciated and tend to always be accepted.
