# Accepted Additions and Requests

I primarily built Auxio as a response to many other music players on android that did far too much, had frustrating UI/UX flaws, or both.

Since I want to keep this app from suffering the same fate as those others, Any requests/additions have to be accepted my **me** (OxygenCobalt) before I implement them or merge them.

All guidelines from the [Contribution Guidelines](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) still apply.

## Bug Fixes, Optimizations, Library Updates, Formatting, etc.

These will likely be accepted/added as long as they do not cause too much harm to the app's architecture or UX.

## New Options/Customizations

These will be accepted/added if I see the value in the addition of those options and if they don't cause harm to the app's design. Most new options are fine as long as they dont degrade the UI/UX.

**Note:** I will be adding Black Mode/Custom Accents in the future. Read the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for more information.

## Feature Additions and UI Changes

These are far less likely to be accepted/added. As I said, I want to avoid Auxio from becoming overly bloated with features I do not use, and therefore **I will only accept features/UI changes that directly benefit my own usage.** If they do not, then I will reject/ignore them. This does not rule out certain additions, but I am generally less likely to accept these kinds of requests.

Feel free to fork Auxio to add your own features however.

## A Final Note

I am an extremely busy student that only programs in their free time. I also want to do things that aren't Android Dev. As a result, any additions I say I will add may take awhile. **Be patient**.
