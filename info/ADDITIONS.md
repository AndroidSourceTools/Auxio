# Accepted Additions and Requests

I primarily built Auxio as a response to many other music players on android that did far too much, had frustrating UI/UX flaws, or both.

Since I want to keep this app from suffering the same fate as those others, Any requests/additions have to be accepted my **me** (OxygenCobalt) before I implement them or merge them.

All guidelines from the [Contribution Guidelines](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) still apply.

## Bug Fixes, Optimizations, Library Updates, Formatting, Architecture Improvements, etc.

These will likely be accepted as long as they do not cause too much harm to the app's architecture or UX.

## New Options/Customizations

These will be looked at with more scrutiny, as certain customizations may cause harm to the apps UI/UX while still not providing alot of benefits as a whole.

Overall I tend to accept these however if I see the benefits of adding this UI/Behavior customization.

**Note:** I will be adding Black Mode/Custom Accents in the future. Read the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for more information.

## Feature Additions and UI Changes

These are far less likely to be accepted/added. As I said, I want to avoid Auxio from becoming overly bloated with features I do not use, and therefore **I only tend to accept features/UI changes that directly benefit my own usage.** If they do not, then I will reject them. This does not rule out all additions of this kind, but I am generally less likely to accept these kinds of requests/PRs.

Feel free to fork Auxio to add your own features however.

## A Final Note

I am an extremely busy student that only programs in their free time. I also want to do things that aren't Android Dev. As a result, any additions I say I will add may take awhile. **Be patient**.
