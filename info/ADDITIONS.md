# Accepted Additions and Requests

I primarily built Auxio as a response to many other music players on android that did far too much, had frustrating UI/UX flaws, or both.

Since I want to keep this app from suffering the same fate as those others, I have baseline requirements for all contributions.

All guidelines from the [Contribution Guidelines](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) still apply.

## Bug Fixes, Optimizations, Library Updates, Formatting, etc.

These will likely be accepted/add as long as they do not cause too much harm to the app's architecture.

## New Options/Customizations

These will be accepted/added if I see the value in the addition of those options and if they don't cause too much harm to the app's architecture. While I do want Auxio to remain consistent behavior/UI-wise, new options for certain customizations are still welcome.

**Note:** I will be adding Black Mode/Custom Accents in the future. Read the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for more information.

## Feature Additions and UI Changes

These are far less likely to be accepted/added. As I said, I want to avoid Auxio from becoming overly bloated with features I do not use, and therefore **I will only accept features/UI changes that directly benefit my own usage.** If they do not, then I will reject/ignore them.

Feel free to fork Auxio to add your own features however. 

## A Final Note

I am an extremely busy student that only programs in his free time. If I decided to implement/accept an idea, it will take some time. **Be Patient.**
