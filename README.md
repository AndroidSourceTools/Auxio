## About

Auxio is a local music player for android that I primarily built for myself.

It only has the features that I use out of a music player and nothing more, with a Spotify-Like UI/UX combined with elements from [Phonograph](https://github.com/kabouzeid/Phonograph) and [Music Player GO](https://github.com/enricocid/Music-Player-GO).
Its meant to be consistent and reliable, while still being customizable and extendable if one wants to add their own features that I (Personally) don't need.

**Note:** Auxio is still early in development, meaning that some things may change as time passes.
